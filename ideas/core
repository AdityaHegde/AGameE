1. Rogue Like - Random Map! Permanent Death?
2. Open World : Spherical world?
   a. Single goal, 20-30% main quest, rest exploration.
   b. Multiple goals, go anywhere at any moment of time.
3. Progress - Experience on skills rather than the character. Learn skills from observation (+xp to skill) or by using the skill
4. Environment - Every part of the world will go on even if the character isnt around. A mob might be more experienced or dead after a while.
